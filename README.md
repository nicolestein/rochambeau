   ** User Story 1 **
    
    As a player, I want to be able to choose rock, paper, scissors, Spock or lizard and then compete against the computer who also chooses rock, paper, scissors, Spock or lizard. I want to be able to know who won the game based on the ruleset of the game (see below).
   
   ** RuleSet ** 
   
    There are 5 valid moves: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard
    Rock breaks Scissors or kills Lizard (Rock wins)
    Paper covers Rock and beats Spock (Paper wins)
    Scissors cut Paper and kills Lizard (Scissors wins)
    Spock defeats Scissors or Rock (Spock wins)
    Lizard defeats Spock and Paper (Lizard wins)
    
   ** User Story 2 **
    
    As a user, I want to see a scoreboard that tells me how many matches I have own and how many the computer has won. A match is defined by a "best out of three games". 
    
    Based on this user story the app was made so a person can play againest the computer that can randomly choose between a set number of choices Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard or Spock. the user can make a choose what they want to play and then when they have made their choice can press a button initiating the computuers turn. 
    
    There are two score boards on is the current score which includes wins losses and ties. The other score board is a match score board that takes the best of three games and tells the user how many times they have one a match or the computer has won a match.
